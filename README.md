# adp-html-and-jquery-generator
PHP classes to generate HTML tags and JavaScript code to call the jQuery library which uses the PHP __call handler to allow the addition of any HTML tag or jQuery function library call to the current page output. The code of these classes is minimal, as they do not need to have many functions to support all HTML tags or jQuery functions.
